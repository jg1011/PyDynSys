# PyFlow/Notebooks/Examples 

These notebooks each contain an example of a dynamical system, usually from physics, that is implemented as a subclass inheriting from the `EuclideanDS` class. We cover the physical background (if applicable), the programmatic details of creating our class (construction, proper polymorphism, implementation of additional system specific features: e.g. simulations), and an analysis of each system using both features from `EuclideanDS` and features we've designed.
