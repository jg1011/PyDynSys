    "Attach a light rod length $\\ell$ to a hinge at one end, and at the other end attach a particle[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1) of mass $m$. Assume the motion of the particle is subject only to gravitational effects (e.g. no air resistance, dampening effects, etc). Let ${\\bf r}(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ denote the position of the particle at time $t$, where the origin is taken to be at the hinge and the $y$-axis \"points down\" (i.e. is inverted, making gravitational effects positive). Let $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ be our phase space, in this case the set of all possible values of ${\\bf r}$ in our model. \n",

From (1.1), it is further clear that $X$ is a circle radius $\\ell$ about the origin. Thus, we redefine for convience $X \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ and explicitly construct\n",

    "This procedure works quite nicely for this simple toy model. This is rarely the case in reality, which is one of the many motivators for Lagrangian mechanics. To see an example of how much more labourious this approach can be to it's Lagrangian successor in [our double pendulum notebook](double_pendulum.ipynb). \n",

    "The only force impacting the motion of the particle is gravitational, which we denote ${\\bf F}_G$. We also have a tension force, which we denote ${\\bf F}_T$ acting towards the hinge in the direction of the rod, ensuring the particle doesn't simply fall off the rod. \n",
