# PyDynSys 

Docs are auto-generated with mkdocs toolkit. See [mkdocs.yml](../mkdocs.yml) for the configuration. Latex rendering on the webpage is done via [javascript/katex-config.js](javascript/katex-config.js). This latex rendering script was AI generated, but it works so it's been left untouched. Unless something breaks, it will remain this way.

## Contributing

This could really use some cleaning up. Currently we've opted for a class subpage approach for core docs, though the addition of nested method/attribute/property subpages for each class would be ideal. To develop these docs locally, you can run

```bash
cd [path-to-project-root]
mkdocs serve
```

to host a local instance of these docs, after installing the necessary dependencies via 

```bash
pip install pip install -e ".[full]"
```
