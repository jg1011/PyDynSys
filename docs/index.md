# PyDynSys

PyDynSys is a mathematically mature Python dynamical systems library, providing both symbolic and functional support for the analysis of such systems through an object-oriented lens.

Our mission, fundamentally, is to consolidate methods and examples concerning dynamical systems—from the elementary to the cutting-edge—in an easily usable Python library; to provide significant pedagogical value for the student and researcher alike, and to further stimulate the curiosity necessary to motivate further developments in this rich branch of mathematics. 

Our object-oriented architecture facilitates this ambitious mission by structuring both symbolic and numerical capabilities in a unified framework. This allows for both the broad applicability of our utilities and the seamless development of new functionality.

This will not be possible without extensive community effort. We discuss contribution [here](contributing/contributing.md).

## Versioning

Versions 0.x.y are purely experimental and not intended for consumption. They're poorly documented, and were just the necessary sequence of steps required taken to port over legacy functionality into a framework robust enough to facilitate our ambitious goals.

Versions 1.x.y support only Euclidean dynamical systems, but in future versions we plan to support more general systems (e.g. monoid $T$, non-euclidean $X$) and stochastic systems. To work on these core changes, see the relevant feature branches.
